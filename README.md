# Known Exploits

Compiling useful exploits for future references

## Intro

There are many PoC exploit scripts available online but many of them are not verified to have successfully conduct the exploit. As a cybersecurity engineer, I would often come across many of these exploit scripts; some of them may work, some of them won't. 

For those scripts that didn't work, I'll try to fix the script and test them personally. Others are welcome to join in the fun :)
